    <p><strong>Have you ever made a recipe that truly surprised you?</strong>  Normally Iâ€™m not a huge salmon lover, but after one bite of this ultra tender salmon, I was absolutely in love.  I literally did a little dance in the kitchen because I finally found a way that I can enjoy salmon!</p>

    <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Pat salmon dry, then season with salt, pepper, paprika and blackening seasoning (if using). Set aside. Adjust oven rack to middle position, then preheat broiler.</li>
        <li>Add butter and oil to a large, oven-safe skillet over MED-HIGH heat. Once butter is melted, add garlic, water, soy sauce, sriracha, honey and lemon juice and cook 30 seconds or so, until sauce is heated through.</li>
