    <h1>Garlic Butter Steak Bites</h1>
    <img src="../photos/Beef.jpg">
    <p><strong>Garlic butter steak bites</strong> are everything you love about a steakhouse steak, with none of the work. Instead of cooking a whole steak, making a pan sauce, slicing the steak, and dipping into said sauce, these pieces of New York strip steak get cooked in a gorgeous garlic butter that’s built in the same pan the steak is cooked in. Pretty ingenious, right? Here’s how you can have perfect steakhouse bites any night of the week.</p>
    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley leaves</li>
        <li>2 pounds thick-cut New York strip steaks</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mince 4 garlic cloves. Transfer to a bowl and add 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. Chop until you have 1/4 cup fresh parsley leaves, then transfer to a small bowl. Cut 2 pounds New York strip steak into 1-inch cubes, then season them with 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt.
        </li>
        <li>Melt 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter in a large skillet over medium high-heat. Add the steak cubes and sear until browned, flipping them halfway through, 6 to 8 minutes total. Add the garlic and pepper and cook for 1 minute more. Remove from the heat and garnish with the parsley.</li>

    </ol>
