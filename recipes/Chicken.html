        <li> 1 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts, pounded to an even thickness (4 average-sized breasts)</li>
        <li> 1 to 2 teaspoons 21 Salute Seasoning or poultry seasoning</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li> 1/2 cup white wine* or chicken broth, or as necessary</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, or more if you want extra sauce</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon garlic, finely minced; or to taste</li>
        <li> 2 teaspoons fresh parsley, optional for garnishing</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To a large skillet, add the olive oil, pounded chicken, evenly season with 21 Salute, salt, pepper, and cook over medium-high heat for 5 minutes. Do not touch, move, or disturb the chicken while it is searing. After 5 minutes, flip chicken over. It should have a medium golden color. For thicker/bigger chicken breasts, sear for 6-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Allow chicken to cook on the second side for about 5 minutes, or until done and cooked through. Again, do not disturb the chicken while it's searing.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken with a slotted spatula and place it on a plate to rest.</li>
        <li>Using caution, deglaze your skillet by adding wine (or broth) and allow the liquid to bubble up and steam violently for a few seconds.</li>
        <li>Add the butter and allow it to melt, about 1 minute; stir continuously until melted.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minutes; stir continuously.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat off, add the chicken back into the skillet, flip it around in the garlic butter sauce, and spoon the sauce over the chicken.</li>
        <li>Optionally garnish with parsley and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
